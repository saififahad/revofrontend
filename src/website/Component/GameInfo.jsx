        Out of Gas is a high-octane, fast-paced Staking game that takes
        inspiration from popular games like Aviator. In this thrilling twist,
        players join Doug, the daring driver, on a race against time to deliver
        his client safely before running out of gas. Fueled by a mix of
        strategy, excitement, and luck, players place their Stakes, hit the
        road, and decide when to stop for a crucial refuel. The challenge?
        Balancing speed and caution to ensure Doug’s client reaches their
        destination safely and on time. Will you take the risk and go the
        distance, or play it safe and refuel? The choice—and the fate of the
        ride—is in your hands!
